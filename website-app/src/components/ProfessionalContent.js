/*
I am currently trying to break into full-stack development (with a focus on front-end) for free-lancing, internships, and full-time opportunities. With full-stack development I am focusing on refining my skills in both javascript, react, css, sql, and mongoDB.
For my education my degree plan has a focus on machine learning as I plan to go to the University of Florida for my masters
in machine learning. This year I have started to focus on both <Link to='/ProjectPage'>personal projects</Link> and <a href='https://leetcode.com/JayaAnim/'> leetcode problems </a>
to refine my skills in both UI design, data management, and data structures.
